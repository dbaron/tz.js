This is tz.js, a library for working with time zones from JavaScript.

It incorporates data from the tz database (also known as the Olson
database), available at http://www.twinsun.com/tz/tz-link.htm and in
the public domain.

Files currently in the distribution are:

  build.py

    Python script to produce all output (tz.js and tests).

  build-tests.py

    Python script to produce the test output (invoked by build.py).

  compiled-to-json.py

    A working tool for converting the binary timezone data format (see
    tzfile(5), available in the tzcode* file in the tz database) into
    JSON suitable for use in tz.js.

  source-to-json.py

    Work in progress on a tool to replace compiled-to-json.py (at some
    time in the indefinite future) with data allowing the time zone data
    to be represented more compactly.

  tz.js.in

    The source to tz.js, to be compiled using build.py.

A few notes about the goals of this library:

This library intentionally does not support times prior to 1970.  This
is because the timezone database does not split zones if there were
differences within them prior to 1970, as described in
http://www.twinsun.com/tz/tz-link.htm .  This means that while the
information from the zone data is intended to be valid for the reference
city prior to 1970, it is often not valid throughout the zone.
Therefore data from the tz database about transitions prior to 1970 have
been removed to save space, and times prior to 1970 are intentionally
rejected.
